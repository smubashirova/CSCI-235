/**
 * @file RecipeBook.hpp
 * @brief This file contains the implementation of the RecipeBook class as a subclass of BinarySearchTree, which manages Recipe objects.
 * 
 * The RecipeBook class includes methods to manage objects, organize and retrieve recipes based on difficulty level. 
 * The implementation ensures that the recipe book is sorted by difficulty level.
